# Basic Deep Learning for Neuroscience of Vision

## Introduction

Welcome to the official repository for the "Basic Deep Learning Methods for Neuroscience of Vision" mini-course at Fulbright University Vietnam! This course is attempted at laying the groundwork for cross-pollination between artificial intelligence and neural sciences at Fulbright. And by "cross-pollination", we allude to a bidirectional relationship whose dynamics gives rise to something much larger than the sum of the two fields. In other words, through this course and future similar ones, we hope computer science majors get inspirations from how the brain computes (and how it does so with such enigma and maginificence), and students in neural sciences learn to apply some of the newest methods in computer science to their questions of interest. We also hope such an exchange of ideas anticipates even bigger, stranger, and more powerful ideas that perhaps can only be classified under a new intellectual tradition at Fulbrightâ€”namely biologically-inspired artificial intelligence.

The material of this course revolves around the datasets used for the Algonauts 2021 Challenge [[1]](#1) and will be delivered through 1.5 hour Colab-based tutorials. The main programming language will be Python, and the main deep learning framework will be TensorFlow. The tangible outcome of this course should be a minimum-viable deep learning model capable of predicting fMRI data
